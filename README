=============
 Formatting
=============
Inside plugins/PExChat/config.yml you will find the line "message-format"
This is the line you need to edit to change the format of chat messages, it can contain characters, colour codes, and variables.
To use colours use the standard Minecraft colour codes found here: http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Classic_Server_Protocol#Color_Codes

Available variables:
+prefix - The prefix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+suffix - The suffix for this user, or this users group if they don't have one defined.
+name - The users name
+displayname - The users display name (Set by plugins such as Towny)
+groups - All the groups a user is in (see below)
+group - The users group
+healthbar - A visual health bar for this user 
+health - The users current health value (Between 0 and 20)
+message - The message the player typed
+world - What world the player is currently in
+time - Timestamp, configurable in config.yml. Uses the format for SimpleDateFormat - http://bit.ly/dscw40

Example (Default):
message-format: '[+prefix+group+suffix&f] +name: +message'

There is now the option of having an unlimited amount of custom variables in the form of +{varname}
These variables are defined in the Permissions config file under the 'info' header of either the user or the group, the same as a prefix.
If these variables contain the static variables such as +prefix, +suffix, +health, etc then those variables will be replaced with their respective values.
If a variable does not exist then it will be replaced with a blank string.

This example will show the users health where +{var1} is located:

Permissions:
---------------------
    Admins:
        default: false
        options:
            var1: '[+health]'

Config:
---------------------
message-format: '[+prefix&f] +{var1} +name: +message

=============
 Multigroups
=============
This plugin supports users who inherit multiple groups. It can use this to include each group the player is in in the formatted chat message
To achieve this, an additional variable has been added. The "multigroup-format" property in the config file specifies what
the chat formatting for multiple groups looks like. Like "message-format" it can also contain characters, colour codes, and variables.
To enable multigroups, place the +groups tag anywhere in the message-format above. 

Available variables:
+prefix - The prefix of each group to be showed
+suffix - The suffix of each group to be showed
+group - The name of the group to be showed

Example (Default):
multigroup-format: '[+prefix+group+suffix]'

Say the user was in three groups, Herp, Derp and Default. With the above config, anywhere that +groups was added to the
message-format property above would be replaced with "[Herp][Derp][Default]".

PExChat also supports specifying in what order the groups should appear, via the use of tracks.

=============
   Tracks
=============
If you ever used Permissions 3, you would know that a track enables you to specify an order of promotion within P3.
Tracks in PExChat work similarly, however instead of being ranks in a ladder, tracks are just a way of referring to
groups of groups. Tracks can also have a priority specified, tracks with a lower number priority will have their groups
shown before tracks with higher number priorities.
An example of a track in the config follows:

tracks:
	default:
		priority: 1
		groups:
		- Default
	sometrack:
		priority: 2
		groups:
		- Derp
		
Setting up tracks as above will replace the +groups tag with the following, differing from the order above:
[Default][Derp]

Note that because the group "Herp" was not listed in a track, the output of the +groups tag will not include the group.
To disable a track from being shown, set it's priority to zero.

Track variables can also be accessed directly. Assuming a user is only in one group in a track, variables of that group in the
track which the user is in can be accessed directly by putting any of the following tags "+prefix.{trackname}", "+suffix.{trackname}" and "+group.{trackname}"
Where {trackname} is the name given to the track under the tracks property. These tags can be placed anywhere in the message-format property.

Example: for a user in groups herp, derp and default with track config as below:

tracks:
	default:
		priority: 1
		groups:
		- Default
	sometrack:
		priority: 2
		groups:
		- Derp
	anothertrack:
		priority: 0
		groups:
		- Herp

message-format: '+groups <+prefix.anothertrack+group.anothertrack+suffix.anothertrack> +name: +message'

This configuration would result in the following output:
"[Default][Derp] <Herp> playername: message!"

=============
  Aliases
=============
PExChat also includes support for providing an alias for any in-game group. The aliases will appear anywhere the group's name
would have otherwise appeared, with the exception of when the +group tag is used in the message-format property.

Example:
aliases:
	Default: Guest

This would cause any occurence of the name of the "Default" group to appear as "Guest".

censor-list - A comma-separated list of single-quoted words to censor, make sure to have [ and ] around the list
